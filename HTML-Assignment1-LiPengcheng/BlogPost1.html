                <h2><strong>When the City Core Fades: Urban Hollowing in Saskatchewan</strong></h2>

                <p>
                    On October 23, 2023, I set foot in Saskatchewan for the first time.
                    That evening, the sun was already sinking below the horizon, and the cold air carried a crisp sense of desolation.
                    On the plane, I was still picturing an idealized version of this journey: I had always imagined Canadian cities to be peaceful and serene—clean streets lined with charming houses and manicured gardens. I pictured people leisurely strolling in the sunshine, the scent of coffee and pine wafting through the air, everything calm and beautiful.
                    I even booked a highly rated hotel in downtown Saskatoon, hoping to fully immerse myself in the warmth and grace of this city.

                <p>
                    However, the moment I stepped off the plane and walked onto the streets of Saskatoon, a quiet sense of disillusionment set in.
                    The golden glow of the setting sun lit up the empty streets—bright, almost blinding, yet devoid of warmth. The buildings that lined the roads were tall but worn, with “For Rent” or “For Sale” signs taped to their windows. Every now and then, a pickup truck sped past, kicking up a gust of cold wind, but there were hardly any pedestrians in sight.
                    What surprised me most were the scattered figures of homeless individuals, quietly curled up in dilapidated doorways—unmistakably the most visible presence on the street.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I couldn’t help but recall my days in London, Glasgow, and Shanghai—cities where the streets are always filled with life.
                    Even when you came across a homeless person, they were often lost in the crowd, not the focus of the scene. But here, pedestrians seemed to have become a rarity, while the homeless had become a permanent fixture of the neighborhood.
                    It all stood in stark contrast to the image I had of Canada.
                    And it stirred questions in my mind: How could a country so developed and prosperous have a downtown so empty?
                    What had caused the city’s former vibrancy to fade, leaving behind this unsettling stillness?
